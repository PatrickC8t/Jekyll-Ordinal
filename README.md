Jekyll-Ordinal
==============

Jekyll liquid filter to output a date ordinal such as "st", "nd", "rd", or "th".

## Installation

To use this with your [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site, copy `ordinal.rb` to your `_plugins` folder.

__NOTE:__ Because [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) disables the use of any Jekyll plugins with the `--safe` option, if you want to deploy your Jekyll site to GitHub youâ€™ll need to convert the site locally and push the generated static files to your GitHub repository instead of the Jekyll source files.

## Usage

To use the filter, simply pass a date string such as `page.date` or `post.date` and the filter will return the ordinal for that day.

```ruby
{{ page.date | ordinal }}
```

Note that only the ordinal will be returned. This is by design to make the formatting of the ordinal easier such as wrapping it in `<sup>` html tags.

````html
<sup>{{ page.date | ordinal }}</sup>
````
